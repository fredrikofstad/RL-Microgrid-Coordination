## Coordinating energy management for microgrid using reinforcement learning
Scenario: An energy load is supplied by a microgrid as shown in figure 1. The microgrid
has renewable and conventional generation and energy storage, and can buy energy from the
utility grid when necessary. The profile of the energy load varies over the time.
The goal is to develop a RL mechanism that can control the demand-supply of the microgrid
to reduce overall energy cost.
